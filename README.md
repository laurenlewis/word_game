## Synopsis

An interactive, real-time word game for all ages, where the first part of a proverb is generated, players fill in the ending and then vote on their favorite response.

## Motivation

This was my final project in the NYCDA Web Intensive class. I wanted to practice Javascript & learn a new technology (Websockets). I also wanted to take the typical party word game & bring it online so worldwide friends can play.

## Versions

Ruby 2.2.4
gem faye-websocket 0.10.0
gem websocket-rails

Deployed with Heroku.
